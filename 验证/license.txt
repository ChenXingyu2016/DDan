--- CSE HTML VALIDATOR LITE EDITION ---

There is only one version of CSE HTML Validator Lite. UPON ORDERING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING ANY VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE REAFFIRMING THAT YOU ARE BOUND TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

CSE HTML Validator Lite is the least powerful of all the editions. It does NOT support CSS, link, accessibility, PHP, SEO, and JavaScript checking. Also, CSE HTML Validator Lite is not as thorough in its validation results. It also lacks other features that are included in the other editions. There is no day or validation limit with CSE HTML Validator Lite. The lite edition may be freely distributed in its original unmodified form only (for example, the original EXE installation setup program).

CSE HTML Validator Lite is free to use only for personal and educational use, with the exception that it is not to be used to provide a validation service to third parties unless specifically approved in writing by AI Internet Solutions LLC.

CSE HTML Validator Lite is NOT free to use for business, government, or any for-profit use unless paired with a paid license of CSE HTML Validator (standard, professional, or enterprise edition) with the same major version number (like 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, etc.). If you want to use CSE HTML Validator Lite for business, government, or any for-profit use, then please purchase the required paid CSE HTML Validator license to be in compliance with this license agreement.

--- LICENSE TO USE ---

Your license is non-exclusive.

You may not sell, rent, or lease the software to others without the prior express, written permission of AI Internet Solutions LLC.

You may make a reasonable number of copies of any version of the software for backup and archival purposes.

One copy of the trial version of CSE HTML Validator Professional may be used by a single person and on a single computer for evaluation purposes without charge for 30 days or 200 validations, whichever comes first. Reinstalling the same version, or a different version of CSE HTML Validator Professional may or may not restart the trial license.

One license of the registered version of CSE HTML Validator Standard, Professional, or Enterprise may be:

(a) used by a single person who uses the software personally on one or more computers and is the only user of all the computers, or

(b) installed on a single workstation used non-simultaneously by multiple people.

In the case of (a) above, if one license is installed on more than one computer, then only one installation may be used at a time.

You may access the registered version of CSE HTML Validator Standard, Professional, or Enterprise remotely over a network, provided that you have obtained enough licenses to cover the total number of workstations that will use the software over the network. For example, if the software will be accessed from five workstations, then five or more licenses (and not three) are required, even if only a maximum of three of those workstations will run the software at any one time. However, if you have more than ten (10) licenses and you have software that allows you to run CSE HTML Validator from a network and that software also manages the number of concurrent users to make sure it is limited to the number of licenses you have, then you only need the number of licenses that are allowed to run concurrently (minimum of ten (10) licenses).

If you are a registered user, then you are entitled to use this product for your own use.

You must not give away your registration key. Doing so will result in an infringement of copyright. AI Internet Solutions LLC retains the right of claims for compensation in respect of damage which occurred by your giving away the registration code. This claim shall also extend to all costs which AI Internet Solutions LLC incurs in defending itself.

This paragraph applies only when used for personal or educational use. CSE HTML Validator Lite may be used by multiple people and installed on multiple computers. It may also be accessed through a network by an unlimited number of people.
